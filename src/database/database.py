            Parameters
            ----------
            conncection : str
                The connection string that can be used by SQLalchemy.

            echo : bool
                Can be used for debugging; writes the queries for
                SQLAlchemy to the stdout buffer.

            pool_pre_ping : bool
                By default True. Determines if SQLAlchemy should
                do a pre-check before using a connection that is
                already in the pool. By doing this, we can prevent
                it from using dead connections.

            pool_recycle : int
                After how many seconds SQLAlchemy considers a
                MySQL connection to be stale and therefore removed
                from the database.

            pool_size : int
                The size the pool can get.

            pool_overflow : int
                How many connections SQLAlchemy can go over the
                pool_size.

            create_tables : bool
                Specifies if the method should create tables.
